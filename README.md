# Basic Image processing techniques

This project includes basic image procesing techniques, developed in C++ with opencv. It includes 2 components: calling opencv libraries (in demoLib.h) and self-developed functions (called by Main.cpp)

# 1. Read and show images, videos
# 2. Convert color space
  - RGB and HSV
  - RGB and LUV, Lab, YCbCr
# 3. Adjusting color
  - By linear functions
  - By non-linear functions
  - By histogram
# 4. Geometry transformation
  - Scaling
  - Rotating
# 5. Other
  - Edge detection with Canny algorithm
  - Applying convolution operators with some kernel: Gauss, Sobel, FreiChen, Prewitt
